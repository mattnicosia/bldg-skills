description: Before implementing any non-trivial build, ask the user 5+ dynamically generated clarifying questions to surface non-obvious preferences, assumptions, and constraints. Triggers on build/implementation requests — new features, new skills, new scripts, refactors, or any task that produces code or configuration.

> **Demo Library Skill** — This skill is from a demo library. Some configuration values use placeholders (e.g. `{{USER_NAME}}`, `{{COMMUNITY_ID}}`). If something doesn't work, check for placeholder values and replace them with your own information first.

# Reverse Prompt

## When to Trigger

Invoke this skill **before starting implementation** whenever the user asks to build, create, implement, or refactor something non-trivial. Do NOT trigger for:
- Simple lookups, research, or information gathering
- Single-line fixes, typos, or obvious bugs
- Tasks where the user has given exhaustive, specific instructions

## Process

### 1. Analyze the Request

Before generating questions, silently identify:
- **Stated requirements**: What the user explicitly asked for
- **Implicit assumptions**: What you're about to assume without being told
- **Decision points**: Where there are multiple valid approaches
- **Failure modes**: What could go wrong or feel wrong to the user
- **Taste-dependent choices**: Where personal preference determines the "right" answer

### 2. Generate 5+ Questions

Questions must be:

**Non-intuitive** — Don't ask things the user already told you or would obviously think to specify. Bad: "What language should I use?" (obvious from context). Good: "Should this fail silently or loudly when X edge case happens?"

**High-impact** — Each question should meaningfully change the implementation. Skip questions where the answer doesn't affect the code.

**Concrete** — Reference specific scenarios, not abstractions. Bad: "How should errors be handled?" Good: "If the API returns a 429 rate limit, should we retry with backoff, queue for later, or skip and log?"

**Opinionated** — Offer your recommended default with each question so the user can just say "yes" to most. Frame as "I'd default to X — want something different?"

**Categories to draw from** (pick what's relevant, not all):
- Edge case behavior (what happens when things go wrong)
- Scope boundaries (what's explicitly OUT of scope)
- Integration points (how this connects to existing systems)
- Output format/style preferences
- Performance vs. simplicity tradeoffs
- Naming, structure, and convention choices
- Dependencies and tooling preferences
- Security/privacy considerations
- Idempotency and state management
- User-facing copy/tone (if applicable)

### 3. Ask Using AskUserQuestion

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present questions. For each question:
- Keep the question text short and specific
- Put your recommended default as the first option with "(Recommended)" suffix
- Include 1-2 meaningful alternatives as other options
- The user can always pick "Other" for custom input

Batch into 1-4 AskUserQuestion calls (the tool supports 1-4 questions per call). If you have more than 4 questions, make multiple calls.

### 4. Proceed with Build

After receiving answers, incorporate them as hard constraints for the implementation. Do not re-ask or second-guess the answers. Just build.

## Example

User: "Build a skill that scrapes competitor YouTube channels"

Good questions:
- "I'd default to scraping via RSS feeds (fast, no auth needed, but limited to last 15 videos). Want full channel scraping via API instead?"
- "Should this run on-demand only, or also support a scheduled cron-style mode?"
- "When a channel returns no data (deleted/private), should I skip silently or flag it in the output?"
- "Output to a local markdown file in active/, or directly to a Google Sheet?"
- "Should I deduplicate against previous runs, or treat each run as independent?"

Bad questions:
- "What programming language?" (obvious from workspace)
- "Should I add error handling?" (always yes)
- "Do you want it to work well?" (meaningless)
