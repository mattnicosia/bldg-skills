# Outline Generator — YouTube Course Pipeline

Generate production-ready course outlines for 2-3 hour longform YouTube videos. Output matches {{USER_NAME}}'s proven course structure (see reference: `active/youtube-strategy/outlines/ai-agents-prompting-course-2026.md`).

## When to Use

- User has a course idea / keyword they want to cover
- User provides research, notes, or raw material to turn into a structured outline
- User says "outline", "course outline", "plan a course", or invokes `/outline-generator`

## Inputs

The user provides some combination of:
1. **Topic / keyword** — what the course is about (e.g., "n8n advanced automations", "Claude Code from zero")
2. **Packaging context** — target audience, angle, positioning vs competitors
3. **Raw research / notes** — bullet points, links, techniques, anything they've collected
4. **Reference outlines** — existing outlines to match in depth/style (optional)

If inputs are sparse, ask the user to provide more before proceeding. Don't generate from thin air.

## Workflow

### Step 1: X Research (if topic warrants it)

Run 3-5 targeted queries via the x-search skill to find cutting-edge discussions, real practitioner techniques, and accounts worth citing. This adds genuine value that {{USER_NAME}} can't get from their own knowledge alone.

```bash
# Broad mode first to map the landscape
.venv/bin/python .claude/skills/outline-generator/x_search_research.py broad -q "What are the most discussed [TOPIC] techniques on X right now? Include specific accounts and posts."

# Then deep mode for actual tweets with citations
.venv/bin/python .claude/skills/outline-generator/x_search_research.py deep -q "[TOPIC] advanced techniques OR strategies" --from-date [30 days ago]
```

Compile the best findings — real techniques people are using, accounts to credit, novel approaches {{USER_NAME}} hasn't covered yet.

### Step 2: Generate the Outline

Combine all inputs (user's idea, packaging, raw research, X research) into a structured outline. The outline MUST follow this exact structure:

---

#### Header
```markdown
# [Course Title]: [Subtitle]

Google Doc: (left blank — filled after export)
```

#### Title Options
Exactly 3 title options. Each must:
- Include the primary keyword naturally
- Include "(Full Course)" or "(Full Course 2026)" for search
- Be under 65 characters
- Be formatted for YouTube SEO (keyword-first when possible)

```markdown
## Title Options

- [Keyword]: [Value Prop] (Full Course 2026)
- [Keyword]: [Angle] (Full Course)
- [Keyword] Full Course: [Hook]
```

#### Hook (scripted)
A fully scripted 60-90 second intro {{USER_NAME}} reads verbatim. Structure:

1. **Opening line** — what this video is about (1 sentence)
2. **Credibility** — why {{USER_NAME}} is qualified (business results, student count, real usage)
3. **Positioning** — what level this is, what prerequisites exist
4. **Wow moment tease** — "First, I'll show you something cool in under two minutes..." + describe the wow moment
5. **Section preview** — rapid-fire list of every major technique/section (1 sentence each, make them sound compelling)
6. **Transition** — "Let's not waste any time, here we go."

The hook must name-drop specific, concrete things (not vague promises). Each technique preview should make the viewer think "I need to know how to do that."

```markdown
## Hook (scripted)

[Full scripted text here — {{USER_NAME}} reads this verbatim on camera]
```

#### Section 0: The Wow Moment
Something visually impressive that happens in the first 2-3 minutes. Must be:
- **Visually striking** — multiple things happening at once, or a dramatic before/after
- **Fast** — complete in under 2 minutes of screen time
- **Real** — actually works, not faked or simulated
- **Relevant** — uses techniques from the course (demonstrates the ceiling)

```markdown
# 0. The wow moment — [short description]

[2-3 sentences describing what the viewer sees]

[1 sentence on why this matters / what it demonstrates]

Demo setup: [Exact steps to reproduce this demo. What to pre-configure, what tools are needed, what can go wrong.]

Links:
- [Relevant tool/doc]: [URL]
```

#### Numbered Sections (the course body)
Each section follows this template. Aim for 8-14 sections total depending on course depth.

```markdown
# [N]. [Section type]: [Title]

[1-2 sentence summary of what this section covers and why it matters]

**How it works:** [Detailed explanation. Be specific — include code snippets, configuration examples, or step-by-step breakdowns where relevant. This is {{USER_NAME}}'s reference for what to say on camera.]

**Demo:** [Exactly what to show on screen. What to set up beforehand, what the viewer sees step by step, what the expected result is. Be specific enough that {{USER_NAME}} can reproduce this without thinking.]

**Show the prompt:** [If applicable — the exact prompt, CLAUDE.md block, or configuration. Walk through why each piece is worded the way it is.]

**When to use it:** [1-2 sentences on when this technique is valuable and when it's overkill.]

Sources: [X accounts, blog posts, original discoverers — credit where due]

Links:
- [Resource name]: [URL]
```

Not every section needs all fields. Use judgment:
- Tutorial/technique sections: all fields
- Comparison sections: use a table format instead of demo/prompt
- Strategy/business sections: skip "show the prompt", focus on real numbers and examples
- Intro/context sections: keep short (2-3 min of recording time), skip demo

#### Closing Section: What to Build Next
5 project ideas ranked by difficulty, each referencing techniques from the course. Point to {{COMMUNITY_NAME}}.

```markdown
# [N]. What to build next

[5 numbered project ideas, each with:]
1. **[Project name]** (Techniques [X] + [Y]) — [1-2 sentence description]

Point viewers to {{COMMUNITY_NAME}} for guided builds and community support.

Links:
- {{COMMUNITY_NAME}}: https://www.skool.com/{{COMMUNITY_SLUG}}
- [Other relevant links]
```

### Step 3: Present to User

Output the full outline in a single markdown block. Tell the user:
- Estimated recording time based on section count (~8-12 min per technique section, ~3-5 min for intro/closing sections)
- Which sections need the most demo prep
- Any gaps or sections that need more research

### Step 4: User Adjustments

The user reviews and makes changes. Incorporate feedback, add/remove sections, adjust depth.

### Step 5: Diagram Generation (separate step, after outline is finalized)

After the outline is locked, generate 1-2 diagrams per section using the diagram-generator skill. Diagrams should:
- Visualize the core concept of each section (architecture, flow, comparison)
- Use the hand-drawn whiteboard aesthetic
- Be 16:9 aspect ratio for YouTube

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/outline-generator/generate_diagram.py "[description]" --aspect 16:9
```

### Step 6: Google Doc Export (separate step)

Compile the final outline + diagrams into a Google Doc for recording reference:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/outline-generator/md_to_gdoc.py "active/youtube-strategy/outlines/OUTLINE.md" --title "Course Title — Outline"
```

Uses `gws` CLI under the hood (no Python Google API dependencies needed).

## Quality Checks

Before presenting the outline:

- [ ] Every section has a clear demo that {{USER_NAME}} can actually execute
- [ ] Links are real and current (not hallucinated)
- [ ] Sources credit real people / accounts (verify via X research)
- [ ] Hook previews every major section (nothing left out)
- [ ] Title options include the primary keyword
- [ ] Wow moment is genuinely impressive and takes < 2 minutes
- [ ] Total section count supports 2-3 hours of content (~10-14 sections)
- [ ] No section is too vague to record from — {{USER_NAME}} should be able to sit down and talk through each one without additional research

## Output Location

Save outlines to: `active/youtube-strategy/outlines/[slug].md`

## Cost

- X research: ~$0.10-0.30 (3-5 queries across broad + deep)
- Diagrams: ~$0.02-0.05 each (generated separately in Step 5)
- Total per outline: ~$0.30-0.80
